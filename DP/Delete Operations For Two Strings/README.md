## Problem: Delete Operation for Two Strings

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of steps required to make `word1` and `word2` the same, where in each step you can delete one character in either string.

## Approach

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of steps required to make the substrings `word1.substring(0, i)` and `word2.substring(0, j)` equal.

- We initialize `dp[i][0]` as `i` and `dp[0][j]` as `j` because if one of the strings is empty, the only operation needed is to delete all characters from the other string.
- Then, for each position `(i, j)` in the grid, we check if the characters at positions `i-1` and `j-1` in `word1` and `word2` are the same. If they are, we simply inherit the value from `dp[i-1][j-1]` because no deletion is needed.
- If the characters are different, we need to consider two possibilities: deleting the character at position `i-1` in `word1` or deleting the character at position `j-1` in `word2`. We choose the minimum of these two possibilities and add 1 to it, representing the deletion operation.
- Finally, the value at `dp[len1][len2]` gives us the minimum number of steps required to make both strings equal.

## Time Complexity

Let `m` be the length of `word1` and `n` be the length of `word2`.
- Constructing the initial 2D array takes O(m*n) time.
- Filling in the dp array also takes O(m*n) time since we iterate through all cells once.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is O(m*n).

## Space Complexity

We use a 2D array `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)`, which gives us a space complexity of O(m*n) since we need to store the results of subproblems.

## Implementation

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int len1 = word1.length(), len2 = word2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[len1 + 1][len2 + 1];

        // Initialize the first row and column
        for(int i = 0 ; i <= len1 ; i++){
            dp[i][0] = i;
        }
        for(int j = 0 ; j <= len2 ; j++){
            dp[0][j] = j;
        }

        // Fill the dp array
        for(int i = 1 ; i <= len1 ; i++){
            for(int j = 1 ; j <= len2 ; j++){
                if(word1.charAt(i-1) == word2.charAt(j-1))
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]; // No deletion needed
                else{
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i-1][j] , dp[i][j-1]) + 1; // Choose minimum of deleting from word1 or word2
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[len1][len2]; // Return the minimum number of steps
    }
}
```

This implementation solves the problem efficiently using dynamic programming.
