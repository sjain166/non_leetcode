**Longest Repeating Subsequence**

### Problem Description
Given a string, find the length of the longest repeating subsequence such that the two subsequences don't have the same string at the same position.

**Example:**
- Input: "aabebcdd"
  Output: 3
  Explanation: The longest repeating subsequence is "abd".

### Intuition
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Let's break down the approach:

- We start by defining a two-dimensional array `dp[][]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest repeating subsequence of substrings `str[0…i-1]` and `str[0…j-1]`.
- We iterate over the string `str` and compare characters. If `str[i-1]` is equal to `str[j-1]` and `i` is not equal to `j`, it means we have found a matching character contributing to the repeating subsequence. Thus, we increment the value of `dp[i-1][j-1]` and assign it to `dp[i][j]`.
- If the characters don't match, we take the maximum of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]` and assign it to `dp[i][j]`. This is because the repeating subsequence can occur either in the suffix of the first string or the suffix of the second string.
- Finally, we return `dp[len][len]`, where `len` is the length of the string.

### Time Complexity
Let's analyze the time complexity of the solution:

- We have two nested loops iterating over the length of the string `str`. Hence, the time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string.
- The space complexity is also O(n^2) due to the dynamic programming array `dp[][]`.

### Conclusion
This problem demonstrates the application of dynamic programming to find the longest repeating subsequence in a string. By comparing characters and building up the solution incrementally, we can efficiently find the length of the longest repeating subsequence. The provided solution offers a clear and concise implementation leveraging dynamic programming principles.
